= Messaging Client Java - Samples for Enterprise Messaging

== Description
SAP Cloud Platform Enterprise Messaging provides a cloud-based messaging framework for the development of decoupled and resilient services and integration flows (using SAP Cloud Integration) to support asynchronous communication principles.
Direct integration with SAP S/4HANA Business Event Handling allows efficient development of innovative and scaling extensions.

This sample demonstrates Enterprise Messaging with Java, using combinations of vanilla Java, Spring, and JMS. Details on each sample application and the covered scenario are described in the table _List of sample projects_ below.

For more details of **SAP Cloud Platform Enterprise Messaging** take a look at the link:https://help.sap.com/viewer/product/SAP_ENTERPRISE_MESSAGING/Cloud/en-US[SAP Cloud Platform Enterprise Messaging on SAP Help portal].


== Requirements
Below requirements are necessary for each of the samples.
Further necessary configuration and settings are dependent on the specific sample and are documented within each sample project.

  * Installed _Java 8_ -> link:https://java.com/de/download/[Java download]
  * Installed _Git_ -> link:https://git-scm.com/downloads[Git download]
  * Installed _Maven 3.x_ -> link:https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[Maven download]
  * A _SAP CP_ Account with `Enterprise Messaging Service` is required. +
    For more detailed information and help on how to start with _SAP Cloud Platform Enterprise Messaging_ please check the link:https://help.sap.com/viewer/product/SAP_ENTERPRISE_MESSAGING/Cloud/en-US[SAP help page].
    ** Optional: Installed _CloudFoundry CLI_ -> link:https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html[Installing the cf CLI] 
    *** This must be also fully configured with the corresponding Cloud Foundry landscape to be able to do a `cf push`.
    ** Created Enterprise Messaging Instance (e.g. via cli: `cf cs enterprise-messaging dev emjapi-samples-sapcp -c '{"emname":"xess"}'`)
    *** Include the ability to create required queues (e.g. `NameOfQueue`) via e.g. link:https://help.sap.com/viewer/bf82e6b26456494cbdd197057c09979f/Cloud/en-US/97a0b3c0067044fcba0df174b9c38f5b.html[Dashboard UI]

=== Recommended

  * Installed IDE of choice (e.g. link:https://code.visualstudio.com/[Visual Studio] with installed link:https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.java[Java language support] plugin)

|Application
|Scenario
|Scenario Description

|link:./emjapi-samples-basic[`emjapi-samples-basic`]
|Basic Messaging Client Java sample for SAP Cloud Platform Enterprise Messaging.
|This sample demonstrates how messages can be send and received from a non SAP CP application. Therefore the messaging sample consists of a `MessageSender` and a `MessageReceiver` (both as a Java class with just a main method).

|link:./emjapi-samples-sapcp[`emjapi-samples-sapcp`]
|Application for Enterprise Messaging based on Spring Web running on SAP Cloud Platform (@ CloudFoundry (with Enterprise Messaging Service)).
|This sample demonstrates how messages can be send and received from a SAP CP deployed application. Therefore the messaging sample provides a _Spring Boot_ based application which provides REST endpoints for _send_ and _receive_ messages via pre-defined queues (see also `manifest.yml`). The REST endpoints are provided via the `MessageController` and the Enterprise Messaging integration in the `MessagingService`.

|link:./emjapi-samples-jms-basic[`emjapi-samples-jms-basic`]
|Basic sample of how to use the Apache Qpid JMS client in combination with the _Messaging Client Java_ to send and receive messages via SAP Cloud Platform Enterprise Messaging.
|This sample demonstrates how messages can be send and received from a non SAP CP application via _JMS_. Therefore the messaging sample consists of a `EmJmsConsumer` and a `EmJmsProducer` which provides the corresponding functionality and an `Application` (which provides a main method to start send/receive samples).

|link:./emjapi-samples-jms-sapcp[`emjapi-samples-jms-sapcp`]
|Application for SAP Cloud Platform Enterprise Messaging via JMS based on Spring Web running on SAP Cloud Platform in the Cloud Foundry environment (with the Enterprise Messaging Service).
|This sample demonstrates how messages can be send and received from a SAP CP deployed application. Therefore the messaging sample provides a _Spring Boot_ based application which provides REST endpoints for _send_ and _receive_ messages via pre-defined queues (see also `manifest.yml`). The REST endpoints are provided via the `MessageController` and the Enterprise Messaging integration as well as the JMS extension in the `MessagingService`.
